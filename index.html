    <span class="problem">THE PROBLEM:  The clarity of the purpose of the coalition and how it wants to accomplish its goals of fighting human trafficking and helping victims is not clearly found on the home page or the site.  We believe people who visit the site may have difficulty finding information easily and quickly.  The organization of the information on the website is hard to understand.</span>
    <span class="solution">THE SOLUTION: We plan on helping improve navigation and organization of the site so that things are easier to find.
